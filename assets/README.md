# Asset Details

## Model files

The final SRGAN model was trained on 600k images from the [OpenImages V4](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) dataset. The weights are released here under the [Apache2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license found in the root of this repository.

_Note: the finetuned model files are hosted on [IBM Cloud Object Storage](http://max-assets.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/max-image-resolution-enhancer/1.0/assets.tar.gz)._

## Test Examples (assets/testexamples)

This directory contains to subdirectories:
* low_resolution
* original

The low resolution images can be used as input for the model, and the resulting high resolution images can be compared with the 'original' images to measure performance.
